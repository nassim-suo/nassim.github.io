# Zongrui Suo

I am a first-year MPhil student at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests include **Large Language Models (LLMs), Graph Reasoning, and Reinforcement Learning in LLMs**. I am particularly interested in developing more interpretable and efficient models that can reason over structured data and adapt to complex environments.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia) at HKUST (Guangzhou). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree from Beihang University. My past research experience includes **contrastive learning on graphs**, where I explored the adaptation of contrastive learning techniques to heterophily graphs. I also worked on **traffic demand prediction** using neural networks to analyze real-world mobility data.

Beyond my research, I have industry experience in software development and large-scale data processing. I interned at **Momenta**, where I contributed to a **spatio-temporal big data analysis and visualization platform** for autonomous driving applications. Additionally, I have worked at **QiJia Youdao Network Technology** and **AIA Group**, where I was involved in backend development, API design, and database optimization.

I am always open to discussions and collaborations in AI research. Feel free to reach out to me at **[zsuo785@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn](mailto:zsuo785@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn)**.
